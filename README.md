# Modern Manchu Print Font

## ‚ú® Project Goals

Building upon the traditional text font "Ginggulere Hergen", this project aims to develop a new typeface for the Manchu script. The glyphs will be adjusted for improved appearance in various formal contexts, including printing and PDF rendering. Additionally, a **bold** version and an *italic* version of the typeface will be developed.

## üìú License

This project operates under the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/). This means all source files, documentation, and outputs are open source.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

You can download and directly install the compiled font file \(\.ttf\) without any building requirements.

### ü§ù Contributing

We welcome your contributions to help make this font better\! You can make your own changes based on the provided source files. Seeking for your help to make it better.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

The glyphs for this typeface are built with FontLab VI software. The transformation scripts, or the OpenType features, which are essential for the Manchu script, are edited with Microsoft VOLT.

Accordingly, the project's source files contain a FontLab project file \(\.vfc\) and a MS VOLT project file \(\.vtp\).

\*\*Note for Contributors:\*\* Despite the OpenType features will be ultimately encoded in, and could be directly edited within the FontLab project file, we require summiteers include a MS VOLT project file whenever update a open-type feature, together with a correspondingly updated FontLab project file.
